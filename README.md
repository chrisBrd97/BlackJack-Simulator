# BlackJack-Simulator
This is a simulation of a simplified version of the game of Blackjack. Only two participants are active for each game,
one player and the dealer, cards are drawn for the "other players" but they do not take part. This version of Blackjack
does not include the ability to Double or Split, players can only Hit or Hold. Player decision making is decided before
each game begins and follows a set of rules that don't change.
